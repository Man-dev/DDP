TITLE = {The Application of Weighted Entropy Theory in Vulnerability Assessment and On-Line Reconfiguration Implementation of Microgrids},
JOURNAL = {Entropy},

NUMBER = {2},
PAGES = {1070--1088},

ABSTRACT = {With the consideration of randomness of distributed generations and loads, this paper has proposed a method for vulnerability assessment of microgrids based on complex network theory and entropy theory, which can explain the influence of the inherent structure characteristics and system internal energy distribution on the microgrid. The vulnerability assessment index is built, and the on-line reconfiguration model considering the vulnerability assessment of microgrid is also established. An improved cellular bat algorithm is tested on the CERTS system to implement the real time reconfiguration fast and accurately to provide the basis of theory and practice.},
