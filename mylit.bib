Three-dimensional modeling is carried out to estimate the convective and radiative heat loss from the receiver for different angles of inclination and operating temperatures. Incorporating reflectors in the modified cavity receiver for second stage concentration, the natural convection heat losses are reduced by 29.23, 19.81 and 19.16{\%}, respectively. The receiver with the trumpet reflector has shown better performance as compared to other configurations.",
