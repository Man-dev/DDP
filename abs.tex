This stage zero report on the topic of microgrid reconfiguration begins by presenting general concepts about microgrids and what reconfiguration means. Then a review of microgrid reconfiguration follows, in which various objective functions, constraints, methods and other considerations regarding microgrid reconfiguration as an optimization problem is presented. Finally some challenges for microgrid reconfiguration are noted and future work is discussed.
