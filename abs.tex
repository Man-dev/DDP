\begin{Abstract}
This stage one report on the topic of numerical simulation for a solar thermal application begins by giving an overview of the requirement of solar thermal applications and its numerical study. Then a summary of experimental work and numerical analysis performed by researchers over last two decades has been given. Followed by work done till stage zero is given which includes verification of software against benchmark solutions for natural convection has been given. Later work done after stage zero is described which includes natural convection in a trapezoidal cavity and verification of Ray Optics simulation. Finally, future work which is remaining to be done in this field is discussed.
